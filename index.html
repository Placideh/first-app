<h1>Placide From East African Developer</h1>
<p>this is my first way of learning how to use  git and  github and it looks cool dealing with it and I am kind look like I am entering int the good stage
of becoming an advanced learner and I am waiting to call myself a junior developer after that I manage to create some projects as well as mastering those
java languages that I can use to develop any application ,also I do want to start creating some static websites like hosting my own portfolio talking
about me.</p>
<p>
	this will going to take me like a whole year . And after this year I will be working in a given 
	bootcamp so as to make my portfolio strong so that's one of the things that I will be doing 
	during this year if things went well I can find a given company so as to work as an intern in  order to get to use on how they work on their daily basis and that will also increase my confidence on calling myself an junior developer.

	so far what I have learned in using git is the commands and well knowing about how the commits and the local repository and also the remote repository as well knowing how to initialize the git plus to create my own user name and also my 
	email




			here is the list of what I have learned so far

			1.git --version //check which git version I am using on my local machine
			2. git --init //this create the git initialization to the folder or the project that you are working on or what you will be working on.
			3. git add <file> //it helps to add some files that we created on folder which is on the projects

			4.git status //usually it helps to check what files that are in the staging area

			5.git rm --cached <file> //this is used  to remove a given file which is on the staging area.
			6.git rm --cached <file with(*.hmtl)>// it removes all the files that has an extension of .html 
			7.git add *.html // this also help all files that ends with and extension of html.
			8.git add . //this means that It will add all the files that are in our project folder automatically


			9. on git status when there is some changes that you have made it will pop up a message down called modified showing that there is a modification  in the staging area so what you need to do is to type git add .// this command will again add them all.


			10. git commit // this will autoamtically take us on the editor that is imbedded in git . and it allow us to kind write some message when we are committing 
			after you can check out you will find that there is nothing to commit if you type git status.


			11.git commit -m 'message' // this is the shorter way of writing the comment or the message to the commits or changes made instead of going to change in the stupid editor.

			12.touch .gitignore //this command will help us to not add some files when we type git add so it is only created with an extension of .gitignore and once the thing that we created but we don't want to commit them we simply add their names into the files of git ignore extension.
			and then after the only thing that can be added it is only the .gitignore 
			we can even add a folder in the gitignore file. so to make sure that the folder is in the gitignore we just add a / forward slash and then the name of the directory or folder.

			13.git branch <nameof the branch> // this helps not to always make changes on the master we don't want to always directly change every commit to the master. we do want to make change to the master once we feel like our code is in good state working. 


			14. git checkout <name of the branch> // with this command what it does is to help us switch from master branch to our branch.

			after making the switching from master to another branch and when we don want to make some changes on the files that was in the master branch it will occur but when we try to go back to master branch all of those added codes will not appear in the master class . so to make a changer or to include all of those change we are goin to need a command that connect the other branch to the master so that them master may get to add all of those changes. we make those changes while we are in the master branch that command is git merge <name of the branch> that we want that to add to the  master branch.

			15. git merge <branch name> // this is the command that helps to merge from the sub-branches changes  to the master branch. after typing that command it will
				give us an editor to write the message or the reason why we are making those changes to the master.

				sometimes we use branches when we are not working on project alone but when you are working on the project with other you will need to make that branch so that you are not affecting others code or you are changing to the master.
