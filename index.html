<h1>Placide From East African Developer</h1>
<p>this is my first way of learning how to use  git and  github and it looks cool dealing with it and I am kind look like I am entering int the good stage
of becoming an advanced learner and I am waiting to call myself a junior developer after that I manage to create some projects as well as mastering those
java languages that I can use to develop any application ,also I do want to start creating some static websites like hosting my own portfolio talking
about me.</p>
<p>
	this will going to take me like a whole year . And after this year I will be working in a given 
	bootcamp so as to make my portfolio strong so that's one of the things that I will be doing 
	during this year if things went well I can find a given company so as to work as an intern in  order to get to use on how they work on their daily basis and that will also increase my confidence on calling myself an junior developer.
</p>

	so far what I have learned in using git is the commands and well knowing about how the commits and the local repository and also the remote repository as well knowing how to initialize the git plus to create my own user name and also my 
	email




			here is the list of what I have learned so far

			1.git --version //check which git version I am using on my local machine
			2. git --init //this create the git initialization to the folder or the project that you are working on or what you will be working on.
			3. git add <file> //it helps to add some files that we created on folder which is on the projects

			4.git status //usually it helps to check what files that are in the staging area

			5.git rm --cached <file> //this is used  to remove a given file which is on the staging area.
			6.git rm --cached <file with(*.hmtl)>// it removes all the files that has an extension of .html 
			7.git add *.html // this also help all files that ends with and extension of html.
			8.git add . //this means that It will add all the files that are in our project folder automatically


			9. on git status when there is some changes that you have made it will pop up a message down called modified showing that there is a modification  in the staging area so what you need to do is to type git add .// this command will again add them all.


			10. git commit // this will autoamtically take us on the editor that is imbedded in git . and it allow us to kind write some message when we are committing 
			after you can check out you will find that there is nothing to commit if you type git status.


			11.git commit -m 'message' // this is the shorter way of writing the comment or the message to the commits or changes made instead of going to change in the stupid editor.

			12.touch .gitignore //this command will help us to not add some files when we type git add so it is only created with an extension of .gitignore and once the thing that we created but we don't want to commit them we simply add their names into the files of git ignore extension.
			and then after the only thing that can be added it is only the .gitignore 
			we can even add a folder in the gitignore file. so to make sure that the folder is in the gitignore we just add a / forward slash and then the name of the directory or folder.
